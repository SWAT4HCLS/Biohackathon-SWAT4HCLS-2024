# Biohackathon-SWAT4HCLS-2024
We are thrilled to announce an exciting evolution in our hackathon day, a cornerstone of the SWAT4HCLS event. Traditionally, our participants have gathered on the last day in an unconference format to delve into hacking, discussions, and drafting new project proposals and research papers. Building on last year's collaboration with the renowned BioHackathon – an event with its roots in Japan and now celebrated globally, including significant editions like the Elixir BioHackathon – we are deepening our alignment.

Our audience has consistently shown interest in SWAT4HCLS conferences and various biohackathons worldwide. This shared enthusiasm has been evident in recent research papers where authors have credited both SWAT4HCLS and the Biohackathon(s). Acknowledging this, and reflecting the spirit of biohackathons, we transitioned last year to naming our hackathon day as Biohackathon-SWAT4HCLS.

This year, we are taking another exciting step forward. While the last day remains dedicated to the hackathon, we will be extending the Biohackathon-SWAT4HCLS experience throughout the event. By offering a dedicated biohackathon space on the preceding days, participants can delve deeper into their hack projects, culminating in the presentations that traditionally close the SWAT4HCLS event. Join us in this enriched experience and dive deeper into innovation and collaboration!
